# Security & Performance

## Security Gate
- Input validation, output encoding.
- Secrets handling, least privilege, authn/authz checks.
- OWASP: injections, XSS, CSRF, SSRF.
- Logs: no PII, add correlation IDs.

## Performance Gate
- No N+1 queries; batch or cache.
- Memory and CPU budgets respected.
- Hot paths profiled if altered.

## Checklist
- [ ] Security implications reviewed.
- [ ] Perf risks noted; budgets unchanged or justified.
- [ ] Telemetry added for new critical paths.

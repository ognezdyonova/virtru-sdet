# MCP Integration

## Tools
- `repo/fs/ripgrep`: local full-text search with path and extension filters.
- `http/openapi`: fetch and validate official specs/contracts.
- `git`: `blame/log` for change provenance and impact analysis.

## Usage Rules
- Prefer local MCP before web search.
- Narrow queries by path, language, and file type.
- If results are ambiguous, state selection criteria and re-query.

## Query Template
- Goal, scope, paths, keywords, exclusions, expected anchors/sections.

## Checklist
- [ ] MCP query logged in evidence block.
- [ ] Results cross-checked against ADR/API specs.
- [ ] Ambiguities resolved or flagged with next steps.

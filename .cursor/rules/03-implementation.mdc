# Implementation

## Planning
- Decompose into steps/substeps. Define minimal increment.
- Identify integration points. Add feature flag if risk > low.
- Define contracts, inputs/outputs, and invariants.

## Coding Rules
- SOLID, clean architecture, type safety.
- No public contract changes unless required and approved.
- Keep changes atomic and scoped. Remove dead code only if safe.

## Self-Check
- Build and lint clean (no errors/warnings).
- Run unit/integration suites relevant to touched modules.
- Verify backward compatibility on public APIs/schemas.

## Stop Conditions
- Missing contract definition or unclear integration surface.
